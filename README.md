# MERN
My initial setup for working with Mongo, React, Flux, Express, and Node. Just clone the repository, run sudo npm install, and you're good to go

To start Webpack (so you can compile all your React code into the minified bundle.js) just run "npm run dev".
To start the app with nodemon use "npm start".
